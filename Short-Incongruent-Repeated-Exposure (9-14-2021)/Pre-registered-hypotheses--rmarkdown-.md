## Pre-Registration Hypotheses

#This file serves as a pre-registration for the hypotheses in this study regarding global precedence and repeated exposure.

#More specifically, this file shows the hypotheses for this studies regarding the conditions "incongruent/congruent at position 2, incongruent/congruent at position 6 and all congruent/incongruent" x "global, local".

#There are three studies.

#The first study is where one trial consisted of seven back-to-back stimulus presentations. After each presentation, participants were required to respond before moving onto the next presentation. In this study, each presentation consisted of one compound letter (giant letter made of smaller letters) and participants needed to press one of two buttons indicating the presence of a target at either the giant letter level or the smaller letters level. Each trial consisted of one target letter and focus level; this was revealed at the start of the trial (i.e., before the first presentation). Conditions consisted of presenting a congruent compound letter (e.g., Giant A made of smaller A's) or an incongruent compound letter (giant E made of smaller G's) at the second or sixth presentation. The rest of the presentations contained an incongruent compound letter. The control condition was that there was no congruent stimulus for the entire trial (i.e., all six presentations were an incongruent stimulus).

#There are several hypotheses for this study:

#1. Position two will have a larger interference effect (difference in response time to indicate target presence between the presentation of an incongruent stimulus in the control condition and congruent stimulus in the congruent at two condition) than at position six (difference in response time to indicate target presence between the presentation of an incongruent stimulus in the control condition and congruent stimulus in the congruent at six condition).

#2. Response times for global searches will be faster than response times for local searches

#3. Congruent stimulus presentations will have faster response times than incongruent stimulus presentations

#4. There will be a larger reduction of interference effect for global searches than local searches. In other words,the overall difference between the difference between the control condition and congruent at position two condition vs. the difference between the control condition and congruent at position six condition will be much larger for global searches than for local searches.
